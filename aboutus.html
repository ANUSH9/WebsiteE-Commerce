                <h1>What is E-Commerce?</h1>
                <p>E-commerce is the process of selling goods and services over the internet. Customers come to the website or online marketplace and purchase products using electronic payments. Upon receiving the money, the merchant ships the goods or provides the service.

                    Electronic commerce has been around since the early 1990s when Amazon just sold books, but today, it’s a multibillion-dollar industry – and it has gotten even bigger during the pandemic. According to Digital Commerce 360’s analysis of U.S. Department of Commerce data, e-commerce spending hit $347.26 billion in the first half of 2020, up 30% year over year. For comparison, e-commerce sales only increased 12.7% during the first six months of 2019.</p>
